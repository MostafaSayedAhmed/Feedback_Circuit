# Feedback Circuit

## Overview
This PCB is designed to test the functionality of each terminal block on an upper distribution board. It provides a simple yet efficient method to verify the electrical connectivity and correct operation of all connected terminal blocks.

## Features
- **Terminal Block Testing**: Ensures proper connection and functionality of terminal blocks.
- **Status Indicators**: LED indicators provide visual feedback for the testing process.
- **Power Management**: Integrated DC step-down module to regulate power input.
- **Compact Design**: Efficient layout to streamline testing processes.

## Board Components
### Key Elements:
- **Terminal Blocks**: Testing points connected to the upper distribution board.
- **LED Indicators**: Visual feedback for terminal block status.
- **DC-DC Step-Down Converter**: Converts input voltage (e.g., 12V) to operating voltage levels (e.g., 5V, 3.3V) for board operation.
- **Resistors (R1 - R50)**: Used for current-limiting and other circuit purposes.
- **Connectors**: Input/output interfaces for connecting the board to the upper distribution board.

## How to Use
1. **Power Up**:
   - Connect a 12V power supply to the board's main input terminals.
   - Ensure the DC-DC step-down module regulates the voltage properly to the required levels (e.g., 5V or 3.3V).

2. **Connect Upper Distribution Board**:
   - Plug the terminal blocks from the upper distribution board into the corresponding slots on this PCB.

3. **Verify Connections**:
   - Each terminal block's status is indicated by the corresponding LED. 
   - A lit LED indicates proper connectivity and function.

4. **Debugging**:
   - If an LED does not light up, inspect the terminal block connection and associated circuitry.

## Technical Specifications
- **Input Voltage**: 12V DC
- **Output Voltage**: 5V, 3.3V (regulated via step-down module)
- **Indicators**: LEDs for testing status
- **Supported Protocols**: Compatible with terminal blocks of various configurations

## Applications
- Functional testing of terminal blocks on distribution boards.
- Diagnostic tool for debugging electrical connections in larger systems.

## Notes
- Ensure correct polarity when connecting the power supply.
- Always inspect the board for physical damage or misaligned components before use.
- Disconnect power before making any hardware adjustments.
